# Real-Time-Emotion-and-Behavior-Detection-System-

Built an AI-driven system that detects emotions, drowsiness, and gaze behavior in real time using OpenCV & Mediapipe!

🔥 Key Features:

✅ Emotion Recognition – Identifies emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.).

✅ Drowsiness Detection – Monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect fatigue.

✅ Gaze Tracking – Detects if the user is looking away for too long.

✅ Automated Alerts – Plays real-time sound notifications for inattention.

✅ Live Video Analysis – Works seamlessly on webcam input.

🛠 Tech Stack:

🔹 AI/ML Models: TensorFlow, AffectNet, Mediapipe

🔹 Computer Vision: OpenCV, NumPy

🔹 Alert System: Pygame for real-time sound notifications

📌 Applications:

✔️ E-Learning – Track student attention in online classes.

✔️ Workplace Productivity – Monitor employee engagement.

✔️ Driver Safety – Alert drowsy drivers in real-time.
